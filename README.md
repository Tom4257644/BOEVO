<h1>BOEVO - Betting Odds Exploiter Version One</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project aimed to develop a system in which I could identify arbitrage opportunities in sports betting. Arbitrage betting aims to guarantee a profit by taking advantage of differences in odds offered by different bookmakers or betting platforms for the same event. Imagine a scenario where you can bet on the outcome of a sports game, let's say, a soccer match. Different bookmakers offer odds on the game's result, which can vary from one bookmaker to another. Arbitrage betting involves placing bets on all possible outcomes of an event in a way that guarantees you will make a profit, regardless of the actual outcome of the event. This is achieved by carefully calculating the appropriate amount to bet on each outcome so that the total amount wagered is less than the potential winnings.
This worked very well, and the first version of this project was very successful; the problem is to make any real profit, you need to be able to analyse thousands of events as they update, which can often be once every few minutes; it would not be sustainable to do this by hand. Version two of this project involved web scraping odds from the different bookmakers in New Zealand. The problem I ran into was that sports betting companies are not too keen on this type of activity, so my web scraping attempts were blocked by enough of the NZ bookmakers to make the strategy unrealistic. This is why version one is included instead of version two.
